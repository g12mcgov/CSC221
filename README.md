School Work from CSC221 - Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Part I


The work in this repository are from my computer science class during my Sophomore. Each lab makes specific 
use of a data structure, such as a Stack, Heap, etc... 

Some of the source files require c++11 and to run, you must append -std=c++0x to the command line arguments. Such as:

       >> g++ -std=c++0x Driver.cpp -o temp
       >> ./temp
       
I suggest you use g++ to compile.
